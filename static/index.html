    <h1>John Norwood's Personal Website</h1>
    <p>
        Hello and welcome to my personal website. I am a software engineer with 10 years of professional experience. Web
        development is (obviously) not my strong suit, but if you take a look at my other personal websites, you'll see
        that I do in fact what CSS is. I have actually done a fair bit of full-stack web development, mostly with <a href="https://react.dev/">react</a>
        and assorted backend technologies, and while it's not my specialty, or even something I particularly like to do,
        I hope the sites linked below demonstrate that I do know how to some simple web development.

        My professional specialties do include network engineering, data engineering, site reliability engineering, and devops.
        I have spent the last 5 years of my career working at <a href="https://cloudflare.com/">Cloudflare</a>, where I
        did a bit of all of the above. For more details, see my <a href="https://github.com/norwoodj/docs/blob/master/docs/resume.md">resume</a>.
    </p>
    <p>Here are the links to my other (more interesting) personal websites:</p>
    <table>
        <tr><td><a href="https://bolas.jmn23.com">Bolas</a></td></tr>
        <tr><td><a href="https://hashbash.jmn23.com">Hashbash</a></td></tr>
        <tr><td><a href="https://stupidchess.jmn23.com">Stupidchess</a></td></tr>
    </table>
    <p>
        This page is deployed using <a href="https://pages.cloudflare.com/">Cloudflare Pages</a>. The other sites listed
        above have backend components, and they are deployed on a <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/">Raspberry Pi</a>
        running in my house. If you see an "Argo Tunnel Error" page for any of those sites, then either I am not currently
        looking for a job and I don't feel like wasting the power to keep these sites that nobody ever uses online, or
        my cat knocked the raspberry pi off the table again. This is my cat:
    </p>
    <img src="echo.jpg" alt="Echo is a very bad cat" width="400px" height="600px">
    <p>
        Her name is Echo.
    </p>
    <p>
        Here's a picture of the raspberry pi running those websites:
    </p>
    <img src="raspberrypi.jpg" alt="Raspberry Pi" width="400px" height="600px">
    <p>
        I run <a href="https://ubuntu.com/download/server">Ubuntu Server</a> on this raspberry pi, and I deploy and
        configure the databases, web servers, prometheus, grafana, etc using <a href="https://saltproject.io/index.html">Salt</a>.
        The salt configurations can be found <a href="https://github.com/norwoodj/rpi-salt">here</a>.
    </p>
    <p>Anyways, hire me.</p>
