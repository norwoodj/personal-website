    <h1>John Norwood's Homepage</h1>
    <p>
        Hello and welcome to my homepage. I am a software engineer with (as of 2025) 10 years of professional experience. Web
        development is (obviously) not my strong suit, but if you take a look at the other websites I've built
        for fun and education, you'll see that I do in fact know what CSS is. I have actually done a fair bit of
        full-stack web development, mostly with <a href="https://react.dev/">react</a> and assorted backend
        technologies, and while it's not my specialty, or even something I particularly like to do, I hope the
        sites linked below demonstrate that I can build applications performing a variety of functions, and APIs
        and frontends to display data sensibly.

        My professional specialties do include network engineering, data engineering, site reliability engineering, and devops.
        I spent 2019-2024 working at <a href="https://cloudflare.com/">Cloudflare</a>, where I did a bit of all of the above.

        I have just (as of May 2025) accepted an offer to work at <a href="https://www.oracle.com/cloud/">OCI</a>.

        For more on me and my complete professional experience see my <a href="https://github.com/norwoodj/docs/blob/master/docs/resume.md">resume</a>.

        This page is deployed using <a href="https://pages.cloudflare.com/">Cloudflare Pages</a>. The other sites listed
        above have backend components, and I deploy them on a <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/">raspberry pi</a>
        running in my house. Right now, I have a job I'm excited about, so I've taken the raspberry pi offline. You'll
        see "Cloudflare Tunnel Error" pages for all of those sites. I'll leave in the joke I had before about how if you
        see one of those aforementioned error pages, then either I'm not looking for a job or my cat knocked the
        raspberry pi off the table again. This is my cat:

        Here's a picture of the raspberry pi running those websites:

        I run <a href="https://ubuntu.com/download/server">ubuntu server</a> on this raspberry pi, and I deploy and
        configure the databases, web servers, prometheus, grafana, etc using <a href="https://saltproject.io/index.html">salt</a>.
        The salt configurations can be found <a href="https://github.com/norwoodj/rpi-salt">here</a>.
